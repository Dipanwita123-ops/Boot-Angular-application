Angular comes with many built-in features that help you build powerful, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Here's a categorized overview:

✅ 1. Modules
NgModule: Organizes the app into logical parts.

Built-in modules:

BrowserModule: Required for running the app in a browser.

FormsModule / ReactiveFormsModule: For template-driven and reactive forms.

HttpClientModule: For making HTTP requests.

✅ 2. Components
Core building blocks of Angular UI.

Each component has:

A template (HTML)

A class (TypeScript logic)

Metadata (decorator with configuration)

Decorated with @Component.

✅ 3. Templates & Directives
HTML enhanced with Angular syntax:

*ngIf, *ngFor: Structural directives to add/remove DOM elements.

ngClass, ngStyle: Attribute directives to change styles/classes.

Binding types:

Interpolation: {{value}}

Property binding: [src]="imageUrl"

Event binding: (click)="doSomething()"

Two-way binding: [(ngModel)]="username"

✅ 4. Services & Dependency Injection
Services: Share logic/data across components (e.g., a UserService).

Angular provides built-in DI system to inject services easily.

Decorated with @Injectable.

✅ 5. Routing
RouterModule enables SPA (Single Page Application) navigation.

Built-in directives like:

routerLink, router-outlet, ActivatedRoute

✅ 6. Forms
Template-driven forms: Easier, uses FormsModule and ngModel.

Reactive forms: More powerful and scalable, uses FormControl, FormGroup, and ReactiveFormsModule.

HttpClientModule: To make HTTP calls (GET, POST, etc.)

Built-in features like:

Interceptors

Error handling

RxJS integration

✅ 8. Pipes
Transform data in templates (e.g., formatting dates, currency).

Built-in pipes:

date, uppercase, lowercase, currency, json, slice, etc.

✅ 9. Lifecycle Hooks
Methods that run at specific stages of a component:

ngOnInit(), ngOnDestroy(), ngOnChanges(), etc.

✅ 10. Animations
Angular has a built-in @angular/animations module for creating smooth, customizable animations.

✅ 11. Testing Support
Angular CLI supports:

Unit testing with Karma + Jasmine

End-to-end testing with Protractor or Cypress

✅ 12. Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)
Automates many tasks like:

Creating components/services

Building/running the app

Running tests
