Issue : while adding routing parameter (eg name) to the welcome component  i.e http://localhost:4200/welcome/Dipanwita , Angular wasnt matching to the name ..It was working fine until 
http://localhost:4200/welcome but not with name   /Dipanwita .. was directly going into errorpage since wildcard('**') i.e Errorcomponent is present .

# Redirecting to the error page when you access /welcome/Dipanwita

🔍 What’s likely happening:
If /welcome/Dipanwita goes to the ErrorComponent, then that means:

Angular does not recognize /welcome/Dipanwita as matching any route

So it goes to the catch-all route: { path: '**', component: ErrorComponent }

##  WHAT FIXED THE ISSUE...
==> Initially, your route welcome/:name was not working — the app was redirecting to the wildcard route (** → ErrorComponent) when visiting /welcome/Dipanwita.
You commented out the wildcard route — then /welcome/Dipanwita started working.
Later, you re-enabled the wildcard route and found that everything still worked fine.

🧠 Why It Failed Before — and Why It Works Now
This is a classic case of Angular route recognition not updating due to stale builds or development server issues.

Likely Reasons It Failed Earlier:
Build Cache or Stale Compilation:

Angular sometimes serves a cached version of your app.

Your route change (welcome/:name) may not have been recognized until you forced the rebuild (e.g., by changing the routing config, commenting/uncommenting routes).

Router Order Not Updated in Runtime:

Angular matches routes in the order they appear in the Routes array.

If there was a syntax issue or a previously incorrect route setup, Angular may have fallen back to ** prematurely.

Page Refresh or Direct Access to Deep Links:

When you typed /welcome/Dipanwita directly in the browser, the dev server may not have been ready to handle that route correctly.

✅ Why It's Working Now
When you:

Commented out the wildcard route

Reloaded the app

Then added it back

...you triggered a fresh rebuild of the routing configuration.

So now:
Angular sees and correctly prioritizes welcome/:name before hitting **

The development server (ng serve) is properly set up to return index.html for deep links

✅ Lesson and Best Practices
| Best Practice                                          | Why                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Always keep wildcard route at the end                  | Prevents it from catching valid routes too early      |
| Restart dev server after major route changes           | Forces Angular to rebuild routing table correctly     |
| Clear cache or use incognito when routes don’t work    | To avoid browser caching or stale JS bundles          |
| Use `<base href="/">` in `index.html`                  | Ensures deep links resolve properly                   |
| For production: configure server for deep link support | So `/welcome/:name` works on refresh or direct access |


✅ Conclusion
The route issue wasn’t caused directly by the wildcard path — it was a side effect of Angular not fully rebuilding or recognizing your updated route definitions until you made a structural change (like commenting out a route).

Now that Angular’s routing table is correctly rebuilt and the server is handling requests as expected, your wildcard and parameterized routes work together just fine.



✅ Possible Solution
1. Fix the Order of Routes (Most Important)
Move the ** wildcard route to the end, and make sure welcome/:name is above it.
