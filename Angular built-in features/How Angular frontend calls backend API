You're building a full-stack Angular + Spring Boot project where the Angular frontend (running at http://localhost:4200) calls backend APIs (running at http://localhost:8080) to get data.

Let me explain what is happening step-by-step in this flow ‚Äî including the Observable part you're seeing.

The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restriction is enforced by the browser itself, not by Angular or Spring Boot.

‚úÖ Which browser blocks the request?
All modern web browsers enforce CORS for security. That includes:

Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Microsoft Edge
 etc.

‚ö†Ô∏è CORS enforcement is part of the browser's security model to prevent malicious JavaScript running on one site (like localhost:4200) from accessing resources on another (like localhost:8080) without permission.

üîí Why does the browser block it?
By default, browsers do not allow JavaScript code from one origin to access resources from a different origin (domain + port + protocol). So:

Angular runs on: http://localhost:4200

Spring Boot runs on: http://localhost:8080

These are considered different origins.

So if you try to make an HTTP request from Angular to Spring Boot without CORS enabled, you'll get this error in the browser console:
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8080/hello-world-bean' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy

How to Fix It?
You already did the right thing in your Spring Boot controller:

@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:4200")
This tells Spring Boot:

"It‚Äôs OK to accept HTTP requests coming from the Angular app at port 4200."
If you were calling the backend from Postman, cURL, or a Java client, CORS would not be an issue ‚Äî because CORS is only enforced by 
browsers for JavaScript-based requests.

| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who blocks the request?** | The **browser** (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)                              |
| **Why?**                    | Security ‚Äî to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests             |
| **How to fix?**             | Use `@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:4200")` in Spring Boot |

Quick Analogy:
üè† Host: The address of the office you're going to.

üßë‚Äçüíº Origin: The place you came from (e.g., your company).

üìú Referer: The exact office room or desk you left when you came here.

The office (Spring Boot) may have a policy:

‚ÄúOnly people coming from Company A (localhost:4200) are allowed.‚Äù

And that's why the origin matters most for CORS.

| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Host`    | Target backend server                | Browser     | `localhost:8080`                |
| `Origin`  | Where request *originated*           | Browser     | `http://localhost:4200`         |
| `Referer` | Specific page that triggered request | Browser     | `http://localhost:4200/welcome` |
