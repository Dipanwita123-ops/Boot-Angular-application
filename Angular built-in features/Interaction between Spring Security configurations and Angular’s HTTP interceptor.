Ques stmnt : In my Angular + Spring Boot application, I’m trying to understand the interaction between Spring Security configurations and Angular’s HTTP interceptor.

Here’s the setup:

In Angular, I have an HTTP interceptor (HttpIntercepterBasicAuthService) that attaches a Basic Authorization header to every HTTP request.

In Spring Boot, I have two different configurations for SecurityFilterChain in my SecurityConfig.

⚡ Case 1 (HTTP Interceptor disabled in Angular)
When I disable the HTTP interceptor in app.module.ts like this:

providers: [
  // { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: HttpIntercepterBasicAuthService, multi: true }
]
(a) Spring Security Config: Auth Required

@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
        .cors(cors -> cors.configurationSource(corsConfigurationSource()))
        .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
            .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS, "/**").permitAll() // Allow preflight
            .anyRequest().authenticated() // Require authentication
        )
        .httpBasic()
        .sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS))
        .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())
        .build();
}
👉 Result: ❌ List of todos does NOT appear from backend.

(b) Spring Security Config: Permit All

@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
        .cors(cors -> cors.configurationSource(corsConfigurationSource()))
        .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
            .anyRequest().permitAll() // Permit all requests
        )
        .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())
        .build();
}
👉 Result: ✅ List of todos appears from backend.

⚡ Case 2 (HTTP Interceptor enabled in Angular)
When I enable the HTTP interceptor in app.module.ts like this:

providers: [
  { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: HttpIntercepterBasicAuthService, multi: true }
]
Spring Security Config: (Either .authenticated() or .permitAll())
👉 Result: ✅ List of todos appears in both configurations.

❓ My Questions:
What is the role of the HTTP interceptor in Angular here?

Why does disabling the HTTP interceptor in Case 1(a) cause the backend to block the requests?

Why does switching Spring Security to .permitAll() in Case 1(b) make the list of todos appear?

Why does enabling the HTTP interceptor in Case 2 work even with Spring Security requiring authentication?

What is the underlying concept behind these behaviors?

Answer:
=======
Let’s break it down carefully because this is about how Angular’s HTTP interceptor and Spring Security interact. Understanding why you see different behavior in those two cases requires knowing how authentication is applied to requests from Angular to Spring Boot.

1️⃣ Case 1: With this configuration

.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
    .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS, "/**").permitAll() // preflight requests allowed
    .anyRequest().authenticated()
)
🔒 What it does:

It allows all OPTIONS requests (important for CORS preflight).

But any other request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) requires authentication. If a request is made without credentials, Spring Security will return a 401 Unauthorized.

🟢 This is stricter. Your Angular frontend must send authentication details (like username/password via HTTP Basic Auth or a token).

2️⃣ Case 1 (Modified): With this configuration

.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
    .anyRequest().permitAll()
)
🔓 What it does:

It allows all requests without requiring authentication.

Spring Boot doesn’t check credentials for any API call.

🟢 As a result, Angular is able to fetch the list of todos because the backend is open—no authentication check happens.

✅ The Angular HTTP Interceptor

In your AppModule, you have:


providers: [
  { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: HttpIntercepterBasicAuthService, multi: true }
]
This is the key part. Let’s understand:

🌟 What does the interceptor do?
Your custom HttpIntercepterBasicAuthService looks something like this:


intercept(request: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
  let username = 'user';
  let password = 'password';
  let basicAuthHeaderString = 'Basic ' + window.btoa(username + ':' + password);

  request = request.clone({
    setHeaders: {
      Authorization: basicAuthHeaderString
    }
  });

  return next.handle(request);
}
This interceptor automatically attaches an Authorization header with every HTTP request your Angular app sends.

That header looks like:


Authorization: Basic <base64encoded(username:password)>

So your Angular requests now contain the authentication info Spring Security needs.

🚨 Why do you see different behavior?
📝 Case 1a: HTTP Interceptor is disabled
You’re using:

.anyRequest().authenticated()
But Angular doesn’t send credentials with the request because the interceptor is disabled.

❌ Spring Security sees the incoming request without any Authorization header, so it responds with 401 Unauthorized.

Result: Angular can’t fetch todos.

📝 Case 1b: Security is relaxed with .permitAll()
Since the backend doesn’t check for credentials:

✅ Even though the Angular app isn’t sending an Authorization header, Spring Boot serves the data.

Result: Todos appear.

📝 Case 2: HTTP Interceptor is enabled
Now Angular adds credentials with every request automatically.

Spring Security with:

.anyRequest().authenticated()
✅ sees the Authorization header, validates it, and lets the request through.

Result: Todos appear.

Even if Spring Security is relaxed to .permitAll(), it doesn’t matter whether Angular sends credentials or not; data comes through because no authentication is enforced.

🧠 Underlying Concepts
Angular doesn’t send credentials by default

Browsers don’t include any Authorization headers with fetch/XHR unless you manually set them.

That’s why your HTTP interceptor is essential if the backend expects HTTP Basic Auth.

Spring Security rejects unauthenticated requests

With .anyRequest().authenticated(), Spring expects valid credentials for every request (other than preflight OPTIONS).

If credentials are missing or wrong, it sends 401 Unauthorized.

CORS and Preflight

Your Spring config allows preflight OPTIONS requests:

.requestMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS, "/**").permitAll()
This is necessary for Angular running on localhost:4200 to interact with localhost:8080.

Interceptor fills the gap

Without the interceptor, Angular requests lack authentication.

With the interceptor, Angular sends credentials with every request.

🟢 Why Does Enabling the Interceptor Fix Case 1?
Because Spring Security’s .authenticated() requires credentials, and only with the interceptor enabled do the frontend requests include:

Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded credentials>
Without that header, the backend blocks the request.

When you relax Spring Security to .permitAll(), credentials are not required, so whether Angular sends them or not doesn’t matter.

Summary:

| **Case**                                     | **Spring Config**       | **Interceptor Enabled?** | **Result**                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Case 1: `.authenticated()`                   | Strict (auth required)  | ❌ No                     | ❌ Todos don’t load (401). |
| Case 1 (modified): `.permitAll()`            | Open (no auth required) | ❌ No                     | ✅ Todos load.             |
| Case 2: `.authenticated()` or `.permitAll()` | Any                     | ✅ Yes                    | ✅ Todos load.             |


The interceptor is critical when Spring Security enforces authentication.

Relaxed security works even without the interceptor but is unsafe.
