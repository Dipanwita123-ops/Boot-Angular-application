When you open your Angular application running at http://localhost:4200 and inspect it (using browser DevTools → Console or Network tab), you might sometimes see references to Observable — especially if you're logging or debugging HTTP requests, services, or RxJS streams.

🔍 What does "Observable" mean in this context?
In Angular (and RxJS), an Observable represents a stream of asynchronous data. You often use Observables when working with:

HTTP calls (HttpClient.get() returns an Observable)

Event handling

Reactive forms

Custom services that emit data

⚙️ In DevTools (Inspect):
Here’s what happens:

1. Console Logging an Observable
If you log an observable in your component like this:

console.log(this.http.get('http://localhost:8080/api/data'));

when u inspect into the  browser http://localhost:4200/  under console or network tab:
Observable {_isScalar: false, source: ..., operator: ...}
  
This doesn't mean the data is fetched — it means you're just logging the Observable itself, not the result of it.

 To see the actual data, you must subscribe:
this.http.get('http://localhost:8080/api/data').subscribe(data => {
  console.log(data); // This logs the real response data
});

summary:

| Where                               | What you see                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Console**                         | `Observable {...}` if logged before `.subscribe()` |
| **Console (inside `.subscribe()`)** | Actual response data                               |
| **Network Tab**                     | Actual HTTP request triggered by the Observable    |
| **Without subscribe**               | Nothing happens, request is never made             |
